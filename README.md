Password Strength Checker

Welcome to my Password Strength Checker project. This is for my assignment with SOFT166, a module on my Computer Science course.

This is the repo containing the files for the project. Unfortunately, every time I attempted to upload the file, even when zipped, it was
too big to fit in the repo, so I've been saving it to my cloud drive or just locally. However I have been saving regularly on my other
project repo, so hopefully that could be evidence that I have been using GitHub and not just ignoring it.

At the moment, my project has been done on Visual Studio 2017. I used to use that for past JavaScript projects so it is what I'm most
familiar with. It can be run by opening the .sln file into Visual Studio.
